### Major comments

Important concerns regarding validity or impact. Concerns related to introduction, methods, results, discussion/conclusion.

Numbered comments. Most important listed first.

Relevance:

* Is the topic appropriate for the journal?
    * Will it matter to readers of the journal(e.g., that they will realistically encounter or need to know about for their work)?
    * Will it be of interest to the readers of this journal?

Ethical concerns:

* Has the study undergone a regulatory/IRB review?
* Was informed consent obtained?
* Was the study designed in an ethical manner relative to the participants?

Abstract:

* Does it accurately communicate the main study contributions?

Introduction:

* Does it concisely establish the rationale for the study (1–1.5 double‐spaced pages)? Should establish (1) significance of topic, (2) knowledge gap, (3) how knowledge gap will be addressed.

Methods:

* Are all methods (e.g., data collection, interventions, and statistical analysis) clearly and transparently described?
* Is the description of the methods sufficient to allow this study to be reproduced?
* Are there concerns related to internal validity? Improper study design... Bias...
* Are there concerns related to external validity? ...Was the study performed in relation to persons/place/time to make the results generalisable?

Results:

* Have the necessary analyses been performed to test the authors' hypothesis?
* Could additional analyses be performed to more comprehensively test the hypothesis?
* Are there secondary analyses pertinent to the study objectives that could be performed to improve the study overall?
* Have the data been transparently represented (e.g., in table or figure format)?
* Are there any concerns about the accuracy of reported data or results of analyses?

Discussion:

* Have the data been interpreted fairly and in a balanced manner?
* Have the results been interpreted in the context of existing literature?
* Are conclusions drawn logical from the data?

### Minor comments

Concerns related to keywords, title, syntax/language, grammar, typographical errors.

Numbered comments.

## Decision and writing comments to the editor

Options are:

* Accepted without revision - very rare.
* Minor revisions needed - good, just small changes like around language used around findings/interpretation, small additional analyses, small extra citations
* Major revisions needed - needs large changes like major structural issues (need to reorgniase text), needs more experiments, needs to account for whole new topic in arguments, existing analyses has flaws.
* Inappropriate - bad principle/ethod, not significant contribution.

<!--if you have major comments, does that meean major revisions needed? so not everything around stuff thats not just spelling grammar etc is major?-->

Explain the rationale (e.g., related to how manuscript advances the field, informs clinical care, or motivates a novel line of important investigation) for my decision recommendations.

If I had any sensitive concerns, expressed those here
