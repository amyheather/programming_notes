# Peer review

This was created by sharing my notes and sources with perplexity, and it generated this checklist for me.

## Preparation

**Research the topic.** If you lack background knowledge, research the field before starting. This helps you assess whether the work represents a genuine contribution.[^1]

**Check for duplicates and prior work.** Search for similar papers or earlier versions of this manuscript to ensure originality and identify any potential duplicate publication concerns.[^2][^1]

**Verify your expertise and availability.** Confirm the manuscript is in your area of expertise and that you have sufficient time to complete a thorough review.[^2]

**Check for competing interests.** Identify any conflicts of interest that might affect your objectivity.[^2]

## Reading the Paper

**First read:** Scan the entire manuscript to understand the main message, study design, and overall direction. Ask yourself:

* What contribution does this article make to the field?[^1]
* Is the manuscript original?[^1]
* Is the overall study design appropriate?[^1]
* What are the research question and key claims?[^2]

**Second read:** Conduct a detailed, section-by-section review using the checklists below. Keep everything confidential throughout this process.[^1][^2]

## Section-by-Section Review

As you read each section, note specific concerns with page and line numbers. Categorize issues as **major** or **minor** as you go.[^3][^2]

* Explained how dependencies are managed?[^4]
* Provided code for all scenarios, sensitivity analyses, tables, figures, and reported results?[^4]


## Categorizing Comments: Major vs. Minor

### Major Issues

**Definition:** Significant concerns essential for publication that affect validity, interpretation, or impact. These require substantial changes and warrant re-review.[^5][^6][^3][^4][^1]

**Examples:**

* Fundamental methodological flaws or bias[^6][^4]
* Missing or inadequate data analysis[^6][^4]
* Weak or missing theoretical framework[^6][^1]
* Unclear or unsupported arguments[^3][^5]
* Inadequate description preventing reproducibility[^4]
* Ethical concerns[^4]
* Results not supported by data[^4]
* Conclusions not logical from findings[^4]
* Entire sections needing rewriting or reorganization[^7][^6]
* Missing crucial experiments or analyses[^6]
* Relevance concerns for the journal's scope[^5][^4]

**Rule of thumb:** If you need to see the manuscript again to verify the issues were fixed, it's a major issue.[^6]

### Minor Issues

**Definition:** Important improvements that typically won't affect overall conclusions and aren't essential for publication. These can often be reviewed by the editor alone without re-review.[^3][^5][^4][^1]

**Examples:**

* Clarifying ambiguous statements[^6][^1]
* Typographical or grammatical errors[^4][^1]
* Citation inconsistencies or missing minor references[^6][^1]
* Fine-tuning figures, tables, or formatting[^1]
* Small additional context or citations[^6][^4]
* Syntax and language improvements[^4]
* Keywords and title refinements[^4]

**Rule of thumb:** If the editor can verify the changes without your expertise, it's a minor issue.[^6]

## Writing the Review

### Structure Your Report

Use this standard format:[^8][^3][^2]

1. **Summary paragraph**
2. **Overall impression and recommendation**
3. **Major comments** (numbered)
4. **Minor comments** (numbered)
5. **Confidential comments to editor** (separate section)

### 1. Summary Paragraph

Write 3-5 sentences demonstrating you've read and understood the study. Include:[^3][^2][^4]

* Study objectives and design[^4]
* Key results[^4]
* Authors' conclusions/interpretations[^4]
* Positive contributions made by the article[^4]

This shows the editor you understand the paper and helps authors see your interpretation.[^3]

### 2. Overall Impression and Recommendation

State your recommended decision (explained in next section) and provide your "take-home" message about the manuscript's strengths and weaknesses.[^8][^3]

### 3. Major Comments

**Formatting:**

* Number each comment[^3][^2][^4]
* List most important concerns first[^4]
* Include page and line numbers for easy reference[^3][^2][^1]
* Give concrete examples with direct quotes (bolded or italicized)[^2]
* Be specific and actionable[^9][^3][^2]

**Content:** Address critical concerns from your section-by-section review that fall into the major category. Focus on issues fundamental to the current study—not "next step" suggestions.[^9][^3]

**Tone:**

* Be direct but respectful[^10][^11][^12][^2]
* Be professional and constructive, not offensive[^13][^11][^12][^2]
* Focus on the research, not the researcher[^2][^1]
* Frame as suggestions: "Consider clarifying..." rather than demands[^14][^15][^5]
* Acknowledge authors' effort[^16][^5]
* Avoid defensive or aggressive language[^17]
* Use neutral language without emotionally charged expressions[^18][^19]

**Example structure:** "The methodology section lacks clarity on participant inclusion criteria (page 6, lines 120-125). This makes it difficult to assess whether the sample is representative. Consider adding a detailed explanation of your inclusion and exclusion criteria, including specific thresholds for each criterion."[^15][^14][^16]

### 4. Minor Comments

Use the same formatting and tone guidelines as major comments. List minor issues identified in your section-by-section review. Keep these brief. **Don't focus primarily on spelling and grammar**—these are trivial.[^3][^2]

### 5. Confidential Comments to Editor

**Purpose:** Discuss sensitive information or context that shouldn't be shared with authors. You don't have to write anything here—it's optional.[^20][^11][^21][^12][^13]

**What to include:**

* Your overall assessment summary and rationale for your decision recommendation[^11][^20][^5]
* Novelty and rigor assessment[^11]
* Potential ethical issues (plagiarism, manipulated figures, duplicate publication, human subjects concerns, inappropriate authorship)[^12][^11]
* Sensitive concerns about the manuscript that might be too harsh for authors[^13][^4]
* Context the editor should know (e.g., previous interaction with this manuscript at another journal)[^12]
* Whether manuscript needs language/grammar editing[^11]
* Clarifications if your decision category doesn't fully communicate your assessment[^13]

**Important:** Never contradict your comments to authors here. All scientific evaluation should be in your comments to authors.[^12]

## Making Your Decision Recommendation

### Decision Categories

**Accept without revision:** Very rare.[^4]

**Minor revisions:** Limited changes needed. The manuscript is mostly sound but needs small refinements like clarifying text, fixing tables, adding minor citations, or tweaking arguments. High chance of acceptance if revisions are made properly. Often reviewed by editor only, not sent back to reviewers.[^22][^23][^5][^4][^1]

**Major revisions:** Substantial work required. Examples include:[^22][^4]

* Substantial rewriting needed[^4]
* Key elements missing or inadequately described[^4]
* Significant data issues requiring additional or reanalysis[^4]
* Major structural reorganization needed[^6][^1]
* New experiments required[^6]
* Addressing whole new topics in arguments[^4]
* Existing analyses have flaws[^4]

The manuscript will be sent back to reviewers for re-evaluation. Acceptance is not guaranteed after revision.[^22][^4][^1]

**Reject:** Fundamental flaws that cannot be addressed through revision, inappropriate principle/method, or insufficient contribution. Use when reviewers recommend major revisions but suggest changes authors cannot actually make (e.g., fundamental design flaws).[^24][^4]

### Writing Your Recommendation to the Editor

In your confidential comments, explain the rationale for your recommendation, such as:[^11][^4]

* How the manuscript advances the field[^4]
* How it informs clinical care or practice[^4]
* Whether it motivates important new lines of investigation[^4]
* Whether issues are addressable through revision[^4]
* Any sensitive concerns[^4]


## Final Checks Before Submission

* Have you given a brief summary and highlighted key messages?[^1]
* Have you given positive feedback as well as constructive criticism?[^2][^1]
* Have you clearly marked which concerns are major vs. minor?[^3][^2][^1]
* Are your concerns specific with examples where possible?[^3][^2][^1]
* Have you numbered comments and referred to page/line numbers?[^2][^3][^1]
* Is your feedback constructive and focused on the research?[^2][^1]
* If you were the author, would you understand how to improve the manuscript?[^1]
* If you were the editor, would your comments help them make a decision?[^1]
* Have you checked spelling and grammar in your report?[^1]
* Have you included comments in correct places in the online system (confidential vs. author-facing)?[^1]
* Is your tone professional and respectful throughout?[^10][^12][^11][^2]
* Have you included positive feedback alongside criticism?[^2]
* Have you indicated if you're available to review the revised version?[^2]
* Will you finish on time?[^2]
