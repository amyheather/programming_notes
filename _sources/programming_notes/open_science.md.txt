# Open Science

## Open Science Framework (OSF)

### Project

Create a project, and store all the files related to that project together (e.g. registrations, archived copies of documents like surveys, pre-print publications).

To add project contributors:
* Go to Project --> Contributors
* Give permissions (Admin, Read/Write, or Read)
* If select Bibliographic, this means they're included in the overall citation for the published project

### Registrations

The purpose of a registration is to be transparent about what you plan to do (to prevent hypothesis after done), so you're clear what was confirmatory and what was exploratory, and to prevent fishing for results. These are done, for example, before data collection, or after collection and before analysis.

To create e.g. pre-registration before data collections:
* Go to Project --> Registrations --> New registration
* Select OSF Preregistration template, and complete. When done, click register
* You cannot modify it after registering (defeats the purpose), but you can make a new registration and link it to your old - click on generate new registration, and then in the description, write something along the lines of 'This is a revised pre-registration relating to the previous pre-registration published (DATE) under the same project anme.
