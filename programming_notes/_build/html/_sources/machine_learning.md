## Causality

https://youtu.be/-7vSiWRasxY

* ML learns outcome by finding distinguishing features and how cases differ
* There will be missing data... censored data.. bias...
* ML learns target outcome only as a function of the **observable** data
* People with expert/domain knowledge would be able to identify some of the people or fields missing
* ML also usually fails to account for relationships between variables
* In order to improve AI learning, need to incorporate causal knowledge
* Pearl's ladder of causation: moving from association (what if I see) to intervention (what if I do) to counterfactuals (what if I had done)
* Argues that you can smartly use smaller datasets in causal models to get smart outcomes rather than just throwing big datasets in models and getting useless outcomes
